Hi,

It's Julius McGee, founder of nerdalert.com.

I enjoy creating, uncovering, and disseminating new and interesting views
on technology trends. While doing some online research, I came across your
blog page.

Since we are pretty much targeting the same audience, it would be a great
idea if we could collaborate. I can share some titles which you can select
and then I will proceed with guest content writing.

About The Nerd Alert:
Nerd Alert is dedicated to helping thousands of people with their
Technology needs. We provide personalized tech help for computer setup or
repairs, wireless networking, home network set-up and more.

Let me know if you're interested in working together.

Regards,
Julius McGee
