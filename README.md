# OpenAI Email Assistant

Do you get tons of unwanted emails from people offering you guest blog posts or other services you never asked for? How about using an AI to reply to them.

Here's what you have to do:

* Register with OpenAI
* Install Python prerequisites
* Create a configuration file `~/.email-assistant.yml` (use the one in this folder as a starting point)
* Move the crappy emails into a dedicated folder (I still want to do that by hand)
* Run `reply.py` every now and then.
* Enjoy the results ;)
